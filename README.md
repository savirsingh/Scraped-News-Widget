# Scraped-News-Widget
## News widget written entirely in HTML.

Widget can be added to any website and all CSS styling works.

### Choosing specific category
```
<iframe src="https://scrapednews.pythonanywhere.com/category/tech" title="Widget">
```
Change category to anything you want.


All content is from Scraped News, a news scraping service I made using Python Flask.
